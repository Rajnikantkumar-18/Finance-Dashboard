# Finance-Dashboard
This project focuses on analyzing customer and loan data to assess financial risks, loan performance, and customer demographics using Power BI. The goal is to create an insightful dashboard that helps understand loan distribution, defaults, and credit risk across different customer segments.


**Data Cleaning:** The data was cleaned by handling duplicates, verifying data types, and transforming specific fields like Discount, Order Date, and Ship Date. Custom columns such as Product Amount and Sales Amount were created.

**Data Analysis:** DAX measures were applied to calculate total sales, average order value (AOV), total orders, and customer metrics. Trends in sales, quantity, and discounts were analyzed over time.


**Data Visualization:** Various Power BI visuals were created, including bar charts, line charts, donut charts, and card visuals, to represent key metrics such as sales, profit margin, and regional performance.


**Insights:** Key insights include the impact of discounts on sales, customer segmentation by region, and performance variations across product categories and sales channels.


**Deliverable:** A comprehensive Power BI report visualizing the sales, customer demographics, and product performance. The dashboard provides interactive filtering options for users to explore different segments.
